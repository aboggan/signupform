## Comments, know issues and others
####  As part of wcag validation:
The Select has an error on focus, probably for lacking of contrast.
Checkbox when checked doesnÂ´t have the "square" arround it. This is something I didn't see in the mock. 

#### Error Handling:
I putted an extra checkbox who is triggering an error in the api. I putted two errors msg (bootstrap alert) in the top and bottom.

#### Still room for improvements:
When developing this I came across with many doubts. Regarding wich tools could be the best, technical implementatios, style fine tunning, and  so on. 
I would like to disscuss what others improvements I have in mind.
